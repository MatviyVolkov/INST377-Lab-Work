    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements </h2><br>

    Sometimes you want to <i>draw attention to something</i> in a line of text.<br><br>
    Sometimes you want to <b>strongly emphasize something</b> in the text.<br><br>
    Sometimes you want to <i><b>do both.</b></i>.<br><br>

   <h2>Empty Elements</h2> 
   <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br>
   Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br>
   Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample. <br></p>

    <h2>Images</h2>

    Include the four images in the /images folder below.<br><br>

    Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.<br>
    
    <img src="images/onigiri_1.png" alt="Onigiri 1">
    <img src="images/onigiri_2.png" alt="Onigiri 2">
    <img src="images/onigiri_3.png" alt="Onigiri 3">
    <img src="images/onigiri_4.png" alt="Onigiri 4">

    <hr>
